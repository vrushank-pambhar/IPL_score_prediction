# IPL_score_prediction
In this project i have used IPL data set which i get from kaggle . I use many algorithm for predicting accurate score those algorithms are like(linear regression,Lasso,Ridge regression and Random Forest regression) i get good results from Random forest algorithm so i use Random forest model for deployment and also i deploy this model in flask platform
